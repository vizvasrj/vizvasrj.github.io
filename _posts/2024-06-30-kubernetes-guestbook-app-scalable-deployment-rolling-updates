Hereâ€™s a more detailed and organized project description for the **Guestbook Application** using Docker and Kubernetes:

---

**Project Overview:**
The Guestbook application is a simple web application that allows users to submit text through a web front-end. This application will be built, deployed, and managed using Docker and Kubernetes. The main components include:

1. **Web Front-End**: A text input where users can submit messages.
2. **Kubernetes Deployments and Pods**: Containers for hosting and managing the application.
3. **Horizontal Pod Scaling**: Automatically scale the number of Pods based on the load.
4. **Rolling Updates and Rollbacks**: Updating the application while ensuring zero downtime and supporting rollback to previous versions.

### Step-by-Step Implementation:

#### 1. **Environment Setup and Tools Verification**
   - Verify that Docker, Kubernetes, and command-line tools are installed and configured in your environment.

#### 2. **Build the Guestbook App**
   - Navigate to the `v1/guestbook` directory:
     ```bash
     cd v1/guestbook
     ```

   - Export your namespace for future use:
     ```bash
     export MY_NAMESPACE=sn-labs-$USERNAME
     ```
   - Build and push the Docker image:
     ```bash
     docker build -t us.icr.io/$MY_NAMESPACE/guestbook:v1 .
     docker push us.icr.io/$MY_NAMESPACE/guestbook:v1
     ```

   - Verify that the image has been pushed successfully:
     ```bash
     ibmcloud cr images
     ```

#### 3. **Deploy the Guestbook Application**
   - Edit the `deployment.yml` file in the `v1/guestbook` directory. The deployment configuration defines the number of replicas and the resources allocated (e.g., CPU). Replace `<your sn labs namespace>` with your namespace.
   - Deploy the application using:
     ```bash
     kubectl apply -f deployment.yml
     ```
   - Forward the port to access the application:
     ```bash
     kubectl port-forward deployment.apps/guestbook 3000:3000
     ```

   - Launch your application and test it by entering text into the Guestbook.

#### 4. **Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA)**
   - Apply autoscaling to your deployment using:
     ```bash
     kubectl autoscale deployment guestbook --cpu-percent=50 --min=1 --max=5
     ```
   - Check the status of the HPA:
     ```bash
     kubectl get hpa guestbook
     ```
   - Generate load on the app to observe autoscaling:
     ```bash
     kubectl run -i --tty load-generator --rm --image=busybox -- /bin/sh -c "while sleep 0.01; do wget -q -O- <your app URL>; done"
     ```

   - Watch the scaling process as the number of replicas increases based on load:
     ```bash
     kubectl get hpa guestbook --watch
     ```

#### 5. **Rolling Updates and Rollbacks**
   - Update the app content (e.g., change the title and header in `index.html`), then build and push the updated image:
     ```bash
     docker build -t us.icr.io/$MY_NAMESPACE/guestbook:v2 .
     docker push us.icr.io/$MY_NAMESPACE/guestbook:v2
     ```
   - Update the `deployment.yml` to reflect the new image version (`v2`) and apply the update:
     ```bash
     kubectl apply -f deployment.yml
     ```
   - Check the rollout status:
     ```bash
     kubectl rollout status deployment/guestbook
     ```
   - Roll back to the previous version if needed:
     ```bash
     kubectl rollout undo deployment/guestbook --to-revision=1
     ```
